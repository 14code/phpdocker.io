            <p>PHPDocker.io is a tool that will help you build a typical PHP environment based on Docker with just a
                few clicks. </p>
            <p>It will also generate a suitable Vagrantfile for use on systems which do not support Docker and
                containers natively. The idea is to vm-boot into a very minimal Linux OS (<a
                        href="http://boot2docker.io/" target="_blank">boot2docker</a>) able of running these
                containers.</p>
            <p>Why Docker? If you've been using a typical vagrant + linux + puppet set up for a while, as I have,
                you've probably grown weary of unreliable and never ending provisioning runs. Docker images come
                pre-configured and require minimal set up and no maintenance. There's no extra OS overhead to
                consider, if you run Docker natively, or such overhead is really small in the case of
                boot2docker.</p>

            <p>This is our first, early feeler prototype. Features to come:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dotdeb.org based PHP: PHP's official images are incredibly cumbersome due to compiling of
                    extensions. Just waiting for php-redis and php-memcached PECL extensions to be packaged
                </li>
                <li>PostgreSQL</li>
                <li>Elasticsearch</li>
                <li>RabbitMQ</li>
            </ul>
